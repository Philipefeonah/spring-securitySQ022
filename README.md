## Spring Security Demo with JWT Authentication and Email Sender
This project is a demonstration of a Spring Boot application that uses Spring
Security for JWT token-based authentication and email sending capabilities. 
The application includes functionalities for user registration, email confirmation,
user login, task management, and user logout.


Users can sign up and upon sign up receive a confirmation mail that contains a token that 
can be used to confirm the mail. After confirmation, the user can then sign in and 
upon signing receive a jwt token can provide access to secured URLs.
